# sparkles

This library provides one default export: the Sparkles React component.

`Sparkles` takes a single prop: colors, which (with one exception) is an array of color strings, e.g. "#FFC700", or "hsl(50deg, 100%, 65%)", etc. The one exception is that you can also pass "rainbow" as a plain string to the colors prop. Passing "rainbow" will set the value of the colors prop to a pre-selected list of colors for a rainbow effect as seen in Josh W Comeau's original blog post.
